All participants, including seniors, compete for gross and net titles within their respective flights. Additionally, seniors have an extra opportunity to win the Senior Net trophy. Players aged 65 and above may tee off from the front tees (one set ahead of the regular men's tees); however, choosing this option forfeits their eligibility for events such as the TX or TC Cups.
